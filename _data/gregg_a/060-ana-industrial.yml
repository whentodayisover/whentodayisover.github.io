        #### Industrial Stock
      
        Industry in Gregg today is characterized by large swaths of open space, warehouses and small manufacturing shops surrounded by fields of grass and asphalt. The vast difference in street infrastructure between residential neighborhoods and industrial districts poses a question for how development will play out over the next 50 years. Much of this industrial space stands to be redeveloped as housing, given its strategic location so close to downtown, following patterns that have already begun along Buffalo bayou in the Clinton District and the 2nd Ward. It may not make sense to blindly fill in the street grid in these places, eliminating the qualities of openness and  dramatically increasing the number of roads the city must maintain. Infrastructural continuity, measured from 0 (no streets) to 1 (a downtown grid), offers a way to operating on these latent qualities of the city structure, opening up room for new urban forms.

        #### Industrial Sample Map With Null & 1-Way Switches

        Switches, an abstract representation of street intersections, are a tool to map the continuity of infrastructure. They are objective, and do not simplistically assume that the 4-way intersections of a typical city grid are  better or worse than any other type of switch. Rather, they reveal as a quantity the spatial qualities of both a street system and the spaces it services. Here, residential neighborhoods map closely to 4-way and 3-way switches, while open spaces correlate with the Null and 1-way switches found today around Industrial areas. The switch map allows for controlled manipulation of street continuity, and may suggest ways of reducing the financial burden of infrastructure while bringing in more openness to communities of the 5th Ward today.
