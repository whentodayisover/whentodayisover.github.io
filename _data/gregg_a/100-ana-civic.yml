       ### Civic Centers
       
       The Fifth Wardâ€™s long history has endowed it with a wealth of churches, schools and community centers. Evenly distributed across the district, these institutions represent a dispersed model of public space, found in small pockets everywhere across the ward. While many would benefit from updated facilities and proximity to other institutions, others may not wish to uproot themselves. As a result, the plan for new development is flexible enough to accommodate both consolidation of public space within the holdouts, and pocket preserves beyond their boundaries.

        ###### Sample maps are a way of viewing patterns across the city in context of a rationalized, deeper structure, what we term the smart grid. Straightening property lines, streets, and infrastructural arteries provides an abstract image that avoids the symptomatic noise of circumstance. Every block can be seen with equal potential, compared and analyzed in a general state. All mapped data of property use, vacancy, density, coverage, value and age, comes from the Harris County Appraisal District<sup><A HREF="http://arcweb.hcad.org/parcelviewer/" style="color:rgb(195,207,230)"><font color="c3cfe6">[3]</font></a></sup>. We have translated their specific, parcel-based property data and aggregated it into our rationalized block-based smart grid.
