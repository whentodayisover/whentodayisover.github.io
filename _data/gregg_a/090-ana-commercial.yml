        Businesses in Gregg are clustered along Liberty Street and Lyons Avenue, however expanding the range and number of businesses and retail is a long standing goal of residents and community leaders. A study<sup><A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21832022/wtio-images/References/EMERSON_5th%20Ward%20Housing%20Study.pdf#page=50" style="color:rgb(195,207,230)"><font color="c3cfe6">[4]</font></a></sup> commissioned by the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corporation<sup><A HREF="http://www.fifthwardcrc.org/" style="color:rgb(195,207,230)"><font color="c3cfe6">[6]</font></a></sup> lamented that the ward “lacks a strong ‘center’ that is visible and tangible to casual visitors,” as well as a “relative lack of large scale commercial structures (such as office tower clusters, shopping malls, or universities) or intensive retail activity; this leads to a lack of mental “anchors” in the context of the Houston region at large.” The purpose of the holdout is to fill this void, concentrating development into district centers at the scale of the ward, and leaving room for larger scale development beyond.

        <h6> Sample maps are a way of viewing patterns across the city in context of a rationalized, deeper structure, what we term the smart grid. Straightening property lines, streets, and infrastructural arteries provides an abstract image that avoids the symptomatic noise of circumstance. Every block can be seen with equal potential, compared and analyzed in a general state. All mapped data of property use, vacancy, density, coverage, value and age, comes from the Harris County Appraisal District<sup><A HREF="http://arcweb.hcad.org/parcelviewer/" style="color:rgb(195,207,230)"><font color="c3cfe6">[3]</font></a></sup>. We have translated their specific, parcel-based property data and aggregated it into our rationalized block-based smart grid.
