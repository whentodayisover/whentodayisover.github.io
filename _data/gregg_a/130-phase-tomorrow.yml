        Meaningful cuts in consumption will not be achieved solely through changing light bulbs or purchasing electric cars, it can only come from a holistic approach that alters our high energy lifestyles, lifestyles that are encoded in the form of our cities. Urban building stock that is both small in scale (single-family houses) and disperse in footprint (suburban) adds exponentially to energy expenditure. To recode our patterns of consumption, future building stock must be made of larger, more efficient buildings that decrease our per capita footprint, and it must become denser, achieving the minimum of 60 units per acre required for a sophisticated mass transit system. Last, the building material itself must not contribute to the carbon problem as concrete and steel do, but instead be seen as a container of both carbon and people .If we started to think of cities not just as carbon emitters, but also as carbon repositories; burning carbon into the air, breathing that air into woody biomass, and encapsulating wooden carbon into the structures of new development: the city as carbon sink.
