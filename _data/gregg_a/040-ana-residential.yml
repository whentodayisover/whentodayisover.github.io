        ### Residential Development
        
        Housing in Gregg today is largely detached single family residences built before 1950. A scattering of newer multi-family complexes offers a glimpse of modern economies of scale at work: only larger, more efficient buildings can consistently offer units at market rates. Their success is visible in multi-family occupancy rates exceeding 90%<sup><A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21832022/wtio-images/References/EMERSON_5th%20Ward%20Housing%20Study.pdf#page=85" style="color:rgb(195,207,230)"><font color="c3cfe6">[1]</font></a></sup>, a far cry from the overall prevalence of  vacancy in the ward. Beyond their form and increased efficiency, these newer constructions are less of a departure from the historical fabric than one might think. The majority of housing across the ward is rental, despite having a nearly 25% larger share of single family residences than the City of Houston at large <sup><A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21832022/wtio-images/References/EMERSON_5th%20Ward%20Housing%20Study.pdf#page=56" style="color:rgb(195,207,230)"><font color="c3cfe6">[2]</font></a></sup>. Many detached homes are in fact rented, keeping the overall homeowner to renter ratio comparable to that rest of the Houston. There is realistic potential for larger, more compact development in concentrated locations; the Spine neighborhoods of Gregg 2065 are rooted in the realities of Gregg today. By employing economies of scale—decreasing the per-unit cost by increasing the number of units produced— the plan proposes a public-private partnership that can address the needs of both housing and the environment. The catalyst for this new redevelopment strategy—what makes the plan less plausible today but more plausible tomorrow—is the growing demands for energy conservation and carbon remediation brought about by climate change.

        ###### Switches, an abstract representation of street intersections, are a tool to map the continuity of infrastructure. They are objective, and do not simplistically assume that the 4-way intersections of a typical city grid are  better or worse than any other type of switch. Rather, they reveal as a quantity the spatial qualities of both a street system and the spaces it services. Here, residential neighborhoods map closely to 4-way and 3-way switches, while open spaces correlate with the Null and 1-way switches found today around Industrial areas. The switch map allows for controlled manipulation of street continuity, and may suggest ways of reducing the financial burden of infrastructure while bringing in more openness to communities of the 5th Ward today.
