        The impressive tree canopy of the Gregg district and Fifth ward as a whole exists in part because high vacancy rates and open lots have left space for the ecological assets of the ward to thrive. Trees add far more than visual character to a neighborhood, they provide valuable environmental services by capturing carbon, cleaning air, and cooling structures around them. As the ward densifies and develops, much of its tree canopy stands to be lost to townhouses rolled out with no space between them, as can be seen today in the Clinton district. Yet if development is concentrated, and open lots are valued for their environmental and, with carbon credits, economic potential, the Fifth ward could experience a very different future.
