        ### Ecological Assets
        
        The impressive tree canopy of the Gregg district and Fifth ward as a whole exists in part because high vacancy rates and open lots have left space for the ecological assets of the ward to thrive. Trees add far more than visual character to a neighborhood, they provide valuable environmental services by capturing carbon, cleaning air, and cooling structures around them. As the ward densifies and develops, much of its tree canopy stands to be lost to townhouses rolled out with no space between them, as can be seen today in the Clinton district. Yet if development is concentrated, and open lots are valued for their environmental and economic potential, the Fifth ward could experience a very different future.

        ###### Sample maps are a way of viewing patterns across the city in context of a rationalized, deeper structure, what we term the smart grid. Straightening property lines, streets, and infrastructural arteries provides an abstract image that avoids the symptomatic noise of circumstance. Every block can be seen with equal potential, compared and analyzed in a general state. All mapped data of property use, vacancy, density, coverage, value and age, comes from the Harris County Appraisal District<sup><A HREF="http://arcweb.hcad.org/parcelviewer/" style="color:rgb(195,207,230)"><font color="c3cfe6">[3]</font></a></sup>. We have translated their specific, parcel-based property data and aggregated it into our rationalized block-based smart grid.
