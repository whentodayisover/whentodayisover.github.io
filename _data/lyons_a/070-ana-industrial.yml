        Manufacturing, warehouses, and distribution lots in Gregg today are clustered along the Buffalo Bayou corridor. The vast difference in street infrastructure between residential neighborhoods and industrial districts poses a question for how development will play out over the next 50 years. Much of this industrial space stands to be redeveloped as housing, given its strategic location so close to downtown and the bayou greenway, following patterns that have already begun along Buffalo bayou in the Clinton District and the 2nd Ward. It may not make sense to blindly fill in the street grid in these places, eliminating the qualities of openness and dramatically increasing the number of roads the city must maintain. Infrastructural continuity, measured from 0 (no streets) to 1 (a downtown grid), offers a way to operating on these latent qualities of the city structure, opening up room for new urban forms
