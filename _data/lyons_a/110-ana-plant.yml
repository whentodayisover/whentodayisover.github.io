        The switch is global, the intersection is local, the switch is invitro and the intersection is invivio. The switch is a form, the intersection is a place. The switch is a point in an abstract field, the intersection is a window onto a social world. The switch is quantity, the intersection is quality. Both functions of the switch and the intersection are in play in the spatial diagrams. SWITCH. The switch is an experimental site or, to use the invitro analogy, a petri dish that opens the dynamic form up.
