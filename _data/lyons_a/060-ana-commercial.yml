        Businesses, stores and retail in Lockwood are sparse and mostly tied to the industrial sector, however expanding the range and number of businesses and retail is a long standing goal of residents and community leaders. A study<sup><A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21832022/wtio-images/References/EMERSON_5th%20Ward%20Housing%20Study.pdf#page=50" style="color:rgb(195,207,230)"><font color="c3cfe6">[4]</font></a></sup> commissioned by the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corporation<sup><A HREF="http://www.fifthwardcrc.org/" style="color:rgb(195,207,230)"><font color="c3cfe6">[6]</font></a></sup> lamented that the ward “lacks a strong ‘center’ that is visible and tangible to casual visitors,” as well as a “relative lack of large scale commercial structures (such as office tower clusters, shopping malls, or universities) or intensive retail activity; this leads to a lack of mental “anchors” in the context of the Houston region at large.” The purpose of the holdout is to fill this void, concentrating development into district centers at the scale of the ward, and leaving room for larger scale development beyond.
