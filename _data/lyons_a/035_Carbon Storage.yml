        The infrastructure of buildings, bridges, and other constructions is expected to triple worldwide with demographic and economic changes by 2050 (Seto, Güneralp, & Hutyra, 2012). Much past construction has been from steel, concrete, and brick; however, wood construction innovations (mgb Architecture + Design, 2012) may avoid much of the CO2 release and FF consumption associated with these other products
        
        The ability to store carbon in the built environment solves multiple issues. By 2040, the Houston region is projected to gained about 3 million new residents. New housing will be required. Situated on the bottom of Texas’ Piney Woods, the region can tap into the lumber industry nearby, with a forrest area about the size of Harris county more than enough to accommodate building growth in the region. If all new residential stock was made of locally grown and processed pine as proposed, 36.7 megatons of carbon dioxide would be taken out of the air, essentially for free. Taken to the scale of the globe, this same concept can sustain construction for a population growth of about 3 billion projected by 2050, which translates to 36,665 megatons of CO2 taken from the atmosphere.
