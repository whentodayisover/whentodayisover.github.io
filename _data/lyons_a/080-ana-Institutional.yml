        ### Civic Centers
       
        The Fifth Wardâ€™s long history has endowed it with a wealth of churches, schools and community centers. Evenly distributed across the district, these institutions represent a dispersed model of public space, found in small pockets everywhere across the ward. While many would benefit from updated facilities and proximity to other institutions, others may not wish to uproot themselves. As a result, the plan for new development is flexible enough to accommodate both consolidation of public space within the holdouts, and pocket preserves beyond their boundaries.
