        Carbon 2065 not only reduces energy consumption it pulls carbon out of the atmosphere and stores it. In this regard, it attempts to integrate urban development into the “carbon cycle.” It will achieve this by harnessing photosynthesis and its by-product, wood. The plan exploits the open space that accompanies urban density as an opportunity for large-scale tree plantations capable of pulling carbon directly out of the atmosphere. Through various species planted and harvested over varying time periods, Carbon 2065 becomes a biotic, carbon remediation facility (a tree farm) that is also a habitable urban environment.
        
        If “urban” and “forest” seem in opposition, it is due to a long history of conditioning ourselves to an antagonistic dialectic where the natural serves as an apologetic for the urban. Imposed separation lets us continue to think our urban patterns of development are far away from nature. Climate change strains that suspect distinction. Opposition between urban and natural grows increasingly irrelevant as the residue of one permeates the other. Abandoning categorization, urban forestry combines environmental remediation and building culture into a single integrated approach that would shift our perception of the city. Large scale plots of managed forest alongside large scale urban development pull carbon reduction strategies out of abstract technical approaches to render them livable.
