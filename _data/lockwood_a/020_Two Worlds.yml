        Together, the Third set of pages construct a renewed approach to contemporary urbanism. The argument starts with a definition of the city as “holistic” based on the assumption that cities do not exceed until that moment when the sum of the parts exceed the whole. This is an ancient definition and the succeeding pages argue how the historical city has been conceived holistically, and why holism is still relevant today. While establishing its relevance, the argument nevertheless proceeds to argue that our understanding of holism has to be drastically altered in order to meet the demands on the twenty-fist century city. This redefinition of holism has much to do with reforming the very status of the architectural and urban object. As the background functions of our routine existence proceed to break down, the need to “explicate” what those functions are and how they must be modified is of utmost urgency today. This explication is largely dedicated to a discussion of urban typology—both its necessity and its impossibility in contemporary urbanism. The section ends with speculation on the relation of urbanism to both nature and culture.

        The project will tie into Houston’s unique riverine ecosystem that permeates the entire city though seven east/west bayous running parallel within the city limits. These natural corridors have been recently assembled into a network of continuous PUBLIC spaces that together measure out to 150 miles. Known as Bayou Greenway 2020, the open space of the new district will merge with the bayou corridors (from which they draw water) in a reciprocal relationship of stimulus and re/development. As a green network, Bayou Greenway 2020 will serve as the engine of the next phase of Houston’s development in much the same way as the way the freeway network shaped the city in the past.

        <h2>Urban Environment</h2>
        
        The inner city section of Houston called the Fifth Ward is frequently characterized as a blighted district. The Ward began as a “Freedman’s Town”  founded in 1866 by the regions freed slaves. It is located adjacent to Houston’s Central Business District yet it is a world apart from the corporate ethos that prevails downtown. For many decades the Fifth Ward served as the center of the Houston African-American community. With over one hundred churches and a concentration of Black-owned businesses, the district reached its population peak in the years leading up to the Second World War. With sizable rail yard and an active port on its southern boarder, the Fifth Ward was supported by good jobs all within walking distance. The Fifth Ward was a destination in Houston commonly referred to as “the Nickel.” Four members of Congress came from the Fifth Ward including Barbara Jordon and Mickey Leland. It was also the birthplace of George Forman and Dr. Ruth Simmons.
