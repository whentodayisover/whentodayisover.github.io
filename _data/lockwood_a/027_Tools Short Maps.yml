        <h3>Sample Maps</h3>
        
        Sample maps make it possible to see characteristic programs and effects, and make them actionable at the scale of the entire ward.  By marking blocks with a single function, characteristic programmatic distributions can be read into the fabric  revealing the larger trends apart from circumstantial noise. In the case of the Fifth ward, program is both predictably distributed (housing) and almost completely random (commercial).

        <h3>Switch Maps</h3>
        
        Design at scale allows us to take a quantitative measurement of a districtâ€™s dis/continuity. Given that the principal difference between contemporary and traditional urbanism is a difference between continuous urban fabric and discontinuous urban enclaves, the significance of this measurement cannot be overstated. Inasmuch as discontinuous form is always countered by continuous space discontinuity is about the production of urban space. This method of quantification produces a study that is referred to as a Switch Map. A four way intersection gets the highest rating and the missing intersection gets the lowest rating. The switch is global, the intersection is local, the switch is invitro and the intersection is invivio. The switch is a form, the intersection is a place. The switch is a point in an abstract field, the intersection is a window onto a social world. The switch is quantity, the intersection is quality. Both functions of the switch and the intersection are in play in the spatial diagrams.
