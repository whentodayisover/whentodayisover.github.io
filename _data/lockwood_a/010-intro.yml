        Solutions that work only for wealthy countries, wealthy cities, wealthy neighborhoods or wealthy individuals, are ineffective inasmuch as any solutions to climate change must go mainstream in order to work. Like nothing else before it, climate change is an interconnected problem that is global in scope. Anything less than broad based solutions end up creating life-rafts for those who can afford them leaving behind an increasingly dysfunctional world. In other words, environmental problems and social problems have to be taken on together. To that end, we have chosen one of the most disadvantaged communities in the city of Houston — the historic Fifth Ward — to make our best case demonstration for redevelopment. 
        
        We began this design process with a simple thought experiment. Every building in the Fifth Ward will hit its expiration date at some point in the next fifty years. In other words, every single building, including those few that will be built in the Fifth Ward this year, will pass their functional lifespan in the next half century. If we were to imagine ourselves walking down Lyons Avenue, then, in the year 2065, all the streets and buildings surrounding us would have been rebuilt over the next fifty years. This rebuilding has not yet begun but still exists in the future, as pure potential. The thought experiment consisted of asking a single question from the imagined vantage point of 2065: “how did we do?” Did we build what should have been built? (Did we even imagine what should have been built?) Did we build what was needed to solve the unavoidable social and environmental problems that we face today? How much better could we have done if we had intervened fifty years ago—that is today? The proposal is intended to maximize the latent potential of this fifty year outcome.
