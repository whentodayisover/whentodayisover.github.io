        The switch is global, the intersection is local, the switch is invitro and the intersection is invivio. The switch is a form, the intersection is a place. The switch is a point in an abstract field, the intersection is a window onto a social world. The switch is quantity, the intersection is quality. Both functions of the switch and the intersection are in play in the spatial diagrams. SWITCH. The switch is an experimental site or, to use the invitro analogy, a petri dish that opens the dynamic form up to specific experimentation. It is an abstraction capable of quantifying continuities in the form of a one, two, three and four way status. It allows for a controlled manipulation of spatial continuity. INTERSECTION. The intersection is not only an abstract “switch” with universal properties, it is also a window onto a specific place: the Fifth Ward. As a window, it brings the many and complex qualities of an actual urban environment into play. The intersection is also an urban exclamation point in an otherwise continuous field of streets. It marks a continuous or distributed intensification the urban field that allows for emphasis but does not risk hierarchies.
