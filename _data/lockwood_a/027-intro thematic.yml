        Transformation of the Fifth Ward begins with a program of preservation. These holdouts contain and collect the historical and cultural richness of the Ward today. They are exempt from wholescale redevelopment and remain in the hands of their owners to develop into the future under preservation constraints that assure its anthropomorphic scale and public dimension are not compromised. The precise locations of the holdouts are flexible, but the proportion of saved area to redeveloped area remains close to 1:4. This area based preservation strategy is less about specific buildings, zones, or designations; instead it focuses on the scale and rhythm of the existing fabric. Selective preservation allows the footprint of communities to survive in the face of extreme development pressure. As population and density grows around the holdouts, new amenities such as grocery stores will appear, ensuring that preservation does not lead to stagnation. As the holdouts fill in, they maintain a continuity with the past that can make the future far richer than the present.

        #### <br/>An antiquated model of density.
        
        We remained limited to unrealistic visions of monocentric density. The outrageous sketch that le corbusier made on his first trip to the united states in 1935 is shocking. His plan to transform manhattan into an enormous radiant city is routinely cited as evidence of his relatively unstable, megalomaniacal ambitions. The problem with manhattan, as he stated it to the new york times “is that its skyscrapers are too small, and there are too many of them.” What his sketch demonstrated was urban construction outgrowing its modest infrastructure of traditional blocks and streets, which he proposed to rip up. Density at the foot of these now enormous buildings would bring economic development to a standstill and bring the city to its knees. A new model of density was required.
