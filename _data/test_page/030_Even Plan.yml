        >-Buildings in the Southwest are phased by height, lowest (lightest) come first
        
        >-Buildings in the Northwest are phased by pairs, "twin" buildings come first, regardless of height
        
        >-Buildings in Residential quadrants are phased to preserve the existing fabric up to 2055
        
        >-Few building clusters in early stages, even distribution
        
        >-Even development within the quadrants
        
        >-Even development across the quadrants overall
        
        >-Graphics: Trees are planted in a triangular pattern, which unfortunately works against the cavalier angle
