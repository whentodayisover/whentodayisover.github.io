        ###-Buildings in the Southwest are phased by height, lowest (lightest) come first
        
        ###-Buildings in the Northwest are phased by pairs, "twin" buildings come first, regardless of height
        
        ###-Buildings in Residential quadrants are phased to preserve the existing fabric
        
        ###-Waterfront is privaleged
        
        ###-Few building clusters in early stages
        
        ###-Even dispersment within the quadrants
        
        ###-Even development across the quadrants overall
