        >-Every Phase is complete
        
        >-Buildings in the Southwest are phased by height, exception waterfront band, which comes in faster
        
        >-Buildings in the Northwest are phased by band, with short buildings of following band starting as tall buildings in previous band complete
        
        >-Buildings in Residential quadrants are phased to preserve the existing fabric up to 2055
        
        >-Residential buildings form clusters, particularly the central cluster in 2035 around a subway stop
        
        >-Waterfront residential district fills out fastest, followed by the Post Office district. Northern districts fill out slower
        
        >-Buildings in all quadrants cling to central axes and major spines first
        
        >-Plantation is evenly distributed across all quadrants, creating the most diverse patchwork in later phases.
        
        >-Graphics: Trees are thinned in rows to reinforce band, appearing more regular in later phases
