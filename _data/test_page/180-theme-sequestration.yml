        In the next 40 years, world population will grow from 7 billion to 9 billion. In 2030, energy demand is estimated to grow 50% from now. Biofuel such as coal, gas and oil supplys 80% of world’s need for energy today, and it takes decades to change the energy structure to renewable sources. One thing directly from burning biofuels is the emission of carbon dioxide, it leads to global warming and irreversible climate changes, which will threat the living environment of human beings. In order to offset the affects from global warming, people have to take actions. 

        Most analyses to date of options for mitigating the risk of global climate change have focused on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs). Much less attention has been given to the potential for storing (or “sequestering”) significant amounts of carbon in forests and other ecosystems as an alternative means of offsetting the effect of future emissions on GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. 

        Rather than working with carbon capture and storage technology (CCS), this study has been mostly focused on carbon plantation, which has a potential to integrate forest, urbanism, engineering, economics, and sociology into an organic whole.

        #### 1. Carbon Capture and Storage

        Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technology that can capture up to 90% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions pro­duced from the use of fossil fuels in electricity generation and industrial processes, preventing the carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. The CCS chain consists of three parts; capturing the carbon dioxide, transporting the carbon dioxide, and securely storing the carbon dioxide emissions, underground in depleted oil and gas fields or deep saline aquifer formations.

        #### 2. Carbon Plantation

        In the face of our environmental crisis, one of the most technologically and economically efficient means of reducing the volumetric carbon in our atmosphere is through silvicultural carbon sinks (forests managed for carbon sequestration) (Stavins).

        - The idea of replacing deserts with forests to help the climate.
        - Carbon-farming costs would be competitive over 20 years with carbon capture and storage.
        - “Suitably deployed, these plants could transform unused, barren lands into long-term carbon sinks. The carbon effciency of this bio-ecosystem would compare favourably with all other existing processes for carbon storage and sequestration, including the cultivation of bio fuels.”

        #### 3. Comparison Economics

        Carbon Capture and Storage 
        $ 7-55 per metric ton of CO2 - Overall cost 
        $100 per metric ton of CO2 - Carbon prices must reach

        CARBON PLANTATION 	
        $25-75 per short ton - 300 million tons of carbon per year
        $30-90 per ton - 500 million tons of carbon per year 

        <h6 style="font-weight: normal;">Note: 500 millions tons carbon is about 1/3 of US current carbon emission.</h6>
