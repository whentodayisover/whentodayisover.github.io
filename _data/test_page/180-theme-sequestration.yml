        In the next 40 years, world population will grow from 7 billion to 9 billion. In 2030, energy demand is estimated to grow 50% from now. Biofuel such as coal, gas and oil supplys 80% of world’s need for energy today, and it takes decades to change the energy structure to renewable sources. One thing directly from burning biofuels is the emission of carbon dioxide, it leads to global warming and irreversible climate changes, which will threat the living environment of human beings. In order to offset the affects from global warming, people have to take actions. 

        Most analyses to date of options for mitigating the risk of global climate change have focused on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs). Much less attention has been given to the potential for storing (or “sequestering”) significant amounts of carbon in forests and other ecosystems as an alternative means of offsetting the effect of future emissions on GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. 

        Rather than working with carbon capture and storage technology (CCS), this study has been mostly focused on carbon plantation, which has a potential to integrate forest, urbanism, engineering, economics, and sociology into an organic whole.

        #### 1. Carbon Capture and Storage

        ![Carbon Storage](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14520747/wtio-images/graphics_lyons-assets/theme-sequestration1.png)

        <br/>Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technology that can capture up to 90% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions pro­duced from the use of fossil fuels in electricity generation and industrial processes, preventing the carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. The CCS chain consists of three parts; capturing the carbon dioxide, transporting the carbon dioxide, and securely storing the carbon dioxide emissions, underground in depleted oil and gas fields or deep saline aquifer formations.

        #### 2. Carbon Plantation

        ![Carbon Plantation](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14520747/wtio-images/graphics_lyons-assets/theme-sequestration2.png)

        <br/>In the face of our environmental crisis, one of the most technologically and economically efficient means of reducing the volumetric carbon in our atmosphere is through silvicultural carbon sinks (forests managed for carbon sequestration) (Stavins).

        - The idea of replacing deserts with forests to help the climate
        - Competitive over 20 years with carbon capture and storage
        - Transform unused, barren lands into long-term carbon sinks

        #### 3. Comparison Economics

        ![Carbon Plantation Cost Estimate](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14520747/wtio-images/graphics_lyons-assets/theme-sequestration3.png)

        <br/>Carbon Capture and Storage <br/>
        $7-55 per metric ton of CO2 - Overall cost <br/>
        $100 per metric ton of CO2 - Carbon prices must reach<br/>

        Carbon Plantation<br/>
        $25-75 per short ton - 300 million tons of carbon per year<br/>
        $30-90 per ton - 500 million tons of carbon per year <br/>

        <h6 style="font-weight: normal;">Note: 500 millions tons carbon is about 1/3 of US current carbon emission.</h6>

        #### 4. Carbon Sequestration of Different Tree Species

        ![Carbon Sequestration of Different Tree Species](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14520747/wtio-images/graphics_lyons-assets/theme-sequestration4.png)

        <br/>From This graphs and data,Loblolly Pine tree shows to be effective in carbon sequestration compare to other two species. It takes up around 4.5 tons /acre/ year during 0 to 20 years and also Ponderosa pine shows to be also effective during 60 to 70 years. However, for the shorter periods of time Loblolly Pine tree which is one of the most popular trees in Houston area could be used in effective way of storing Carbon. Bamboo and Eucalyptus also shows that they are very effective for carbon sequestration also. Mose Bamboo could take average 6.88 tons of ccarbon in one acre per year. Eucalyptus could also take average of 4.12 tons of carbon in every year.

        #### 5. Forest Management

        - Young forests grow faster than old forests, so regular harvesting and regrowing can sequester more carbon in the long-term than not harvesting.
        - Forest products store carbon and have lower emissions than alternative products such as concrete and steel, so using wood products from managed forests lowers emissions.
        - A no-cut forest has higher fuel loads and greater burn intensity resulting in greater emissions (>3 times) compared to a managed cut forest (Based on National Inventory Report 2009).
        - Managing the forests so they grow productively is important for sustained mitigation benefit, as is ensuring they are utilised in long-life products and can be utilised to reduce fossil-fuel emissions at the end of their lifespan.

        #### Silvicultural Carbon sinks
        <h6 style="font-weight: normal;">
        Since the 1950s, reduced land-use change in the US has allowed forests, both young and old, to thrive and assist in the fight against global warming through carbon sequestration. Since 1990, forests in the United States have absorbed an average estimated 110 megatons of carbon every year. However, while the US has reduced deforestation to the benefit of the environment, global deforestation and land-use change is on the rise globally and has been adding an annual net 2081 megatons of carbon to the atmosphere. Ultimately, it is fair to say that the forests of the world are being mismanaged to the detriment of the environment. In the face of our environmental crisis, one of the most technologically and economically efficient means of reducing the volumetric carbon in our atmosphere is through silvicultural carbon sinks (forests managed for carbon sequestration) (Stavins).
        </h6><h6 style="font-weight: normal;">
        Proper forestry methods can sequester and store CO2 in greater quantities and for a longer term than natural forest growth. No tree species absorbs carbon at a constant rate over its lifetime; every forest has an ideal maintenance approach for optimizing its carbon sequestration (Stavins). Harvesting also reduces the risk of carbon release via forest fires and decomposition, which together contribute 1.6 gigatons of carbon per year (Ornstein).
        </h6><h6 style="font-weight: normal;">
        Currently, planted forests occupy only 7% of the world’s forest area, but grow 41% of the amount of wood globally harvest. It is predicted that the global infrastructure of buildings, bridges, and other construction is set to triple with demographic and economic changes by 2050 (Set, G Güneralp, & Hutyra). It is well known now that building construction is a significant contributor to green house gas emissions. Steel, concrete, brick, and aluminum consume 17% of the world’s total FF energy, 10% of which can be saved by replacing these materials in buildings with wood, a tactic known as the ‘avoidance pathway’ (Oliver).
