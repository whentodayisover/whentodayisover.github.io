        <br/>Proper forest management could significantly improve plantation’s ability to sequester carbon. It could also prevent carbon emission into the air from bun fire and decay. As part of the overall effort to integrate urban forest into new development, this project thus has more dimensions other than traditional forestry management.

        The idea of typical band is introduced. It is an experiment on a smaller scale, through which we would have an overall view of urban forest in 5th Ward. Typical band is part of the effort to bring urban forest back to urban areas, but it also distinct itself by connecting to new development and wood construction. 1) Multiple species is introduced in order to draw a line from the traditional plantation monoculture. 2) Band length is adapted to species and its proximity with wood construction. 3) Band expands along with the overall ward development.

          <h4>Age 0 - Growing the Seeds</h4>

          The first step in growing a plantation is to germinate the seeds or establish cuttings from selected trees. Forests NSW’ nursery near Tumut us capable of growing over seven million seedlings and cuttings annually. Seed is sown during September and October, ready for planting from June to August the following year. The site where the pine plantation is to be grown needs to be prepared before you can plant the seedlings. Forests NSW plantations are either grown on cleared farmland or re-grown on existing plantation land after a previous timber harvest. Site preparation normally involves ripping and mounding. Herbicides are also applied to kill off competing grass. If not treated with herbicides plantations can fail to grow well.

          <h4>Age 1 - Planting the Seedlings</h4>

          Planting takes place in winter when the seedlings are dormant (not growing) and when the ground is moist. One seedling is planted every w.5 meters along the rows of mounds which are between 3 and 4 meters apart (about 1000 plants/hectare). Fertiliser is sometimes applied.

          <h4>Age 2 - Small Trees</h4>

          After two years the seedlings reach approximately 2 meters in height and begin to suppress competing vegetation. In some case remedial fertiliser is applied to promote well-being.

          <h4>Ages 5, 7 & 9 - Pruning</h4>

          In more productive plantations the best trees have their lower branches pruned up to three times in their lives. They are commonly pruned up to a height of 6.2 meters. The trees that are commonly referred to as pruned logs. Pruned logs are valuable and are used to create high-value products such as plywood

          <h4>Ages 13,21 & 28 - Thinning</h4>

          During the life of a plantation it is necessary to remove (thin) the smaller and weaker trees to give the stronger trees more room to grow. Thinning allows the remaining trees more space, light, food and water. Thinning happens when the trees are at around age 13, 21 and 28. Some of the timber removed during a first thinning is treated with preservative to make it durable for use in landscaping and vineyards. Most first thinning timber is called pulpwood and is processed into small pieces called wood chips. These wood chips are pulped to make newspaper, particle board and kitchen cupboards. The first thinning yields mainly pulpwood or treated posts and the second thinning provides about 40% pulpwood and 60% sawlogs. Third thinning yield 20 pulpwood and 80% sawlogs.

          <h4>Age 30 to 35 - Final harvest</h4>

          The pine trees in a plantation are finally harvested between age 30 and 35. The logs from this final harvest provide most of the building timber for Australian houses and are also used for furniture. The logs are cut then processed into lengths by a mechanical harvest.

        ##Typical Band Length

        1. ![Typical Band Length 1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14520747/wtio-images/graphics_lyons-assets/theme-band_length1.png)

        Longer growth cycles may not capture as much carbon (the right side of the diagram to the left), yet they yield longer lasting wood products: CLT, saw lumber, heavy timber. The “half life” of such products can be significantly higher than that of papers and faster growing woods, meaning the carbon absorption is more stable. Until carbon credit trading is a possiblity, long cycles also represent a greater value when sold, potentially financing further redevelopment. Larger, older trees also provide more shade and pleasing environments, the long growth storage focused plantations cluster around new construction. Planted in a wider triangular pattern, individual trees have more access to sunlight and less competition for nutirients, helping to yield higher quality woods.

        ##Typical Band Construction

        1. ![Typical Band Construction 1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14520747/wtio-images/graphics_lyons-assets/theme-band_const1.png)
        2. ![Typical Band Construction 2](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14520747/wtio-images/graphics_lyons-assets/theme-band_const2.png)

        Bands next to spines, the district infrastructure, would be constructed after enough carbon credits are generated through the plantation. Those specific blocks would first be broken into construction sites. Taking advantage of wood products and carbon credits from the plantation, new wood construction will be zero carbon emission and eco-friendly.

        ##Typical Band Expansion

        Plantation grows on blocks outside of holdout. It expands in phases from block to block under a larger ward banding expansion strategy. Blocks with row houses would be prepared first for plantation. Then seedlings are planted, transforming underdeveloped areas into green spaces, which generate carbon credits, remove air pollutants, and produce wood production.
