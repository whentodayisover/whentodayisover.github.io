        Proper forest management could significantly improve plantation’s ability to sequester carbon. It could also prevent carbon emission into the air from bun fire and decay. As part of the overall effort to integrate urban forest into new development, this project thus has more dimensions other than traditional forestry management. 
        
        The idea of typical band is introduced. It is an experiment on a smaller scale, through which we would have an overall view of urban forest in 5th Ward. Typical band is part of the effort to bring urban forest back to urban areas, but it also distinct itself by connecting to new development and wood construction. 1) Multiple species is introduced in order to draw a line from the traditional plantation monoculture. 2) Band length is adapted to species and its proximity with wood construction. 3) Band expands along with the overall ward development.

          AGE 0 - Growing the seeds or cuttings and preparing the site
          
          The first step in growing a plantation is to germinate the seeds or establish cuttings from selected trees. Forests NSW’ nursery near Tumut us capable of growing over seven million seedlings and cuttings annually. Seed is sown during September and October, ready for planting from June to August the following year. The site where the pine plantation is to be grown needs to be prepared before you can plant the seedlings.

          AGE 1 - Planting the seedlings
          
          Planting takes place in winter when the seedlings are dormant (not growing) and when the ground is moist. One seedling is planted every w.5 meters along the rows of mounds which are between 3 and 4 meters apart (about 1000 plants/hectare). Fertiliser is sometimes applied.
          
          AGE 2 - The seedlings grow into small trees
          
          After two years the seedlings reach approximately 2 meters in height and begin to suppress competing vegetation. In some case remedial fertiliser is applied to promote well-being.

          AGES 5, 7 & 9 - Pruning
          
          In more productive plantations the best trees have their lower branches pruned up to three times in their lives. They are commonly pruned up to a height of 6.2 meters. The trees that are commonly referred to as pruned logs. Pruned logs are valuable and are used to create high-value products such as plywood 

          AGE 13,21 & 28 - Thinning
          
          Thinning During the life of a plantation it is necessary to remove (thin) the smaller and weaker trees to give the stronger trees more room to grow. Thinning allows the remaining trees more space, light, food and water.

          AGE 30 to 35 - Final harvest
          
          The pine trees in a plantation are finally harvested between age 30 and 35. The logs from this final harvest provide most of the building timber for Australian houses and are also used for furniture. The logs are cut then processed into lengths by a mechanical harvest.
