        # Oak
        
        An oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus of the beech family Fagaceae, having approximately 600 extant species. The genus is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in Asia and the Americas. North America contains the largest number of oak species, with approximately 90 occurring in the United States. Mexico has 160 species, of which 109 are endemic. The second greatest center of oak diversity is China, which contains approximately 100 species.

        # Pine
        
        Hailed as the leading commercial timber tree in the southeast United States, the native Loblolly pine grows rapidly with a straight trunk clear of branches.  It reaches 50 feet in just 20 years, and when mature can top 100 feet with a trunk diameter between 2-3 feet.  The bark on young trees is usually dark, blackish-brown and scaly. Mature Loblolly pines are more deeply fissured, have large irregular plates and are reddish-brown. Slender yellow green needles are about 9 inches long. They are stiff, in bundles of 3 (rarely 2) and make quality litter. Female cones are oval to conical, between 2-6

        # Bamboo
        
        Bamboo’s biological characteristics – fast growth and high renewability – make it an excel- lent tool for combating climate change.

        Renewability: Bamboo culms can be harvested regularly and used to make many different types of durable products, such as houses, floorboards or furniture, so the potential for the forest to sequester carbon also depends on the use, lifetime and durability of the harvested material or the prod- ucts it is used to make.
