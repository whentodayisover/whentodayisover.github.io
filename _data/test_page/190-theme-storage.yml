        The infrastructure of buildings, bridges, and other constructions is expected to triple worldwide with demographic and economic changes by 2050 (Seto, Güneralp, & Hutyra, 2012). Much past construction has been from steel, concrete, and brick; however, wood construction innovations (mgb Architecture + Design, 2012) may avoid much of the CO2 release and FF consumption associated with these other products
        
        The ability to store carbon in the built environment solves multiple issues. By 2040, the Houston region is projected to gained about 3 million new residents. New housing will be required. Situated on the bottom of Texas’ Piney Woods, the region can tap into the lumber industry nearby, with a forrest area about the size of Harris county more than enough to accommodate building growth in the region. If all new residential stock was made of locally grown and processed pine as proposed, 36.7 megatons of carbon dioxide would be taken out of the air, essentially for free. Taken to the scale of the globe, this same concept can sustain construction for a population growth of about 3 billion projected by 2050, which translates to 36,665 megatons of CO2 taken from the atmosphere.
        
        #### Carbon Pathways

        Wood can potentially avoid emitting CO2 from fosilfuel to the atmosphere by several pathways:

        - Forest Pathway
        - Storage Pathway
        - Energy Pathway
        - Avoidance Pathway
        - Landfill Pathway

        After Hurricane Gudrun destroyed much of Sweden’s forests, an unused airfield became the world’s largest site for timber storage. Measuring about 42 feet tall, 240 feet wide, and 6,600 feet long, this single location contains 66,528,000 cubic feet of wood. Assuming the trees were largely Sweden’s most common species, European Beech (roughly 44 lbs / cf), about 1.46 megatons of timber can be accounted for on the site. Taken further, this equals about 2.68 megatons of CO2 taken out of the atmosphere and stored in carbon form.
