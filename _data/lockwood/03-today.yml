        ### This is a headline.
        
        This is a pargraph. The best way to communicate is compatible. Compatible communication is listening with open ears and an open mind, and not being fearful or judgemental about what you're hearing.
        
        When you get lost in your imaginatory vagueness, your foresight will become a nimble vagrant.
