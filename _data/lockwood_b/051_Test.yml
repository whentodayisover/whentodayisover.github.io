        Transformation of the Fifth Ward begins with a program of preservation. These holdouts contain and collect the historical and cultural richness of the Ward today. They are exempt from wholescale redevelopment and remain in the hands of their owners to develop into the future under preservation constraints that assure its anthropomorphic scale and public dimension are not compromised. The precise locations of the holdouts are flexible, but the proportion of saved area to redeveloped area remains close to 1:4. This area based preservation strategy is less about specific buildings, zones, or designations; instead it focuses on the scale and rhythm of the existing fabric. Selective preservation allows the footprint of communities to survive in the face of extreme development pressure. As population and density grows around the holdouts, new amenities such as grocery stores will appear, ensuring that preservation does not lead to stagnation. As the holdouts fill in, they maintain a continuity with the past that can make the future far richer than the present.

        Linking together holdouts, new construction, and the city at large is a task that involves many more modes of connection that streets and sidewalks. Transportation, infrastructure, and open space must be choreographed into a livable network balancing the need to get from place to place quickly and efficiently with the quality of the places themselves. This means that the spaces where streets stop can be as important to the city as where they connect, and given the state of the street grid across the ward, in many instances removing a crumbling street and openning up the space left behind may do more for a neighborhood than updating the infratstructure in place. By focusing the city’s efforts on a series of spines spread across the ward, over the course of 50 years a leaner, more compact road system may serve a much larger population. Where these streets end, an extensive network of walkable open space will stitch neighborhoods together, and expand the reach of today’s Bayou Greenway network well beyond the banks of the Buffalo.

        Impactful redevelopment and reduction of energy consumption cannot be achieved through preservation and house by house construction alone. It can only come from a holistic approach that alters our high energy lifestyles, lifestyles that are encoded in the form of our cities. New single family building stock that is both small in scale and disperse in footprint adds exponentially to energy expenditure and cannot serve the existing median income of the fifth ward at market prices. To recode our patterns of consumption, future building stock must be made of larger, more efficient buildings that decrease both our per capita footprint, and the per unit cost. This is can already be seen playing out in portions of lower Frenchtown, where dense new construction is sprouting up block by block. However, so far this development leaves little room for holdouts or open space, and unchecked could erase and displace the existing community fabric. Large scale buildings, open spaces, and smaller scale infill must all exist in tandem to to preserve and progress the ward.
