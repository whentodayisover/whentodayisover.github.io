        If “urban” and “forest” seem in opposition, it is due to a long history of conditioning ourselves to an antagonistic dialectic where the natural serves as an apologetic for the urban. Imposed separation lets us continue to think our urban patterns of development are far away from nature. Climate change strains that suspect distinction. Opposition between urban and natural grows increasingly irrelevant as the residue of one permeates the other. Abandoning categorization, urban forestry combines environmental remediation and building culture into a single integrated approach that would shift our perception of the city. Large scale plots of managed forest alongside large scale urban development pull carbon reduction strategies out of abstract technical approaches to render them livable.
