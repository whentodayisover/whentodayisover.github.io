        Impactful redevelopment and reduction of energy consumption cannot be achieved through preservation and house by house construction alone. It can only come from a holistic approach that alters our high energy lifestyles, lifestyles that are encoded in the form of our cities. New single family building stock that is both small in scale and disperse in footprint adds exponentially to energy expenditure and cannot serve the existing median income of the fifth ward at market prices. To recode our patterns of consumption, future building stock must be made of larger, more efficient buildings that decrease both our per capita footprint, and the per unit cost. This is can already be seen playing out in portions of lower Frenchtown, where dense new construction is sprouting up block by block. However, so far this development leaves little room for holdouts or open space, and unchecked could erase and displace the existing community fabric. Large scale buildings, open spaces, and smaller scale infill must all exist in tandem to to preserve and progress the ward.
        
        >Future construction must balance large buildings that decrease consumption and unit cost, with smaller infill that preserves the character of the ward today.
