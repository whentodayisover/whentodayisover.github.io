        Parcel patterns reveal the legal framework of ownership and lot size, and it is from here that modern economies of scale will first transform the district. Gregg today has a largely fine grain of ownership, with the exceptions of large industrial tracts, rail, and highways. To make large scale development possible, large scale swaths of property will have to be banded together. At the same time, the preservation in the holdout largely determined on the parcel layer. Less about preserving specific buildings or historical designations; the holdout protects the scale and rhythm of the existing fabric. The control mechanism to create the holdout does not have to be a zoning limitation or overly prescriptive building code- concepts quite foreign to a Houston context. Instead, preservation comes in the form of bolstered individual property rights. Holdout land owners are shielded from development pressure by the provision that parcels —individual property lots— cannot be combined within the holdout. No single land speculator can purchase.
