        ><i>"It will be a system that connects Houston’s parks along its major bayous with varying widths of continuous public greenspaces; it will also be a system that threads together major employment centers, major institutions, diverse neighborhoods -- a system that embraces the cultural and socioeconomic diversity of a city that spans nearly 650 square miles."</i>

        >Linking together holdouts, new construction, and the city at large is a task that involves many more modes of connection that streets and sidewalks. Transportation, infrastructure, and open space must be choreographed into a livable network balancing the need to get from place to place quickly and efficiently with the quality of the places themselves. This means that the spaces where streets stop can be as important to the city as where they connect, and given the state of the street grid across the ward, in many instances removing a crumbling street and openning up the space left behind may do more for a neighborhood than updating the infratstructure in place. By focusing the city’s efforts on a series of spines spread across the ward, over the course of 50 years a leaner, more compact road system may serve a much larger population. Where these streets end, an extensive network of walkable open space will stitch neighborhoods together, and expand the reach of today’s Bayou Greenway network well beyond the banks of the Buffalo.
