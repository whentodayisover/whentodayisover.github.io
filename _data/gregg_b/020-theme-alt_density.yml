        In carbon 2065, density is a two-fold operation, no compression without expansion.  Is urban density constructed in the twenty-first century in the same way that it was in the nineteenth or the twentieth? We know from the example of nyc that density of the past was constructed upon the great gridded infrastructures of the 19th century of which the 1811 plan of new york is an emblem. But the gridiron extensions of cities were completely halted following the second world war and since that time our urban development has been built upon an entirely different dna than that of the continuous grid. Is the density produced by spine based urbanism different from the density that was produced by grid based urbanism?  The world has entirely changed in the past half century of spine-based infrastructure, including our understanding of contemporary dwelling.  It is not possible that the underpinnings of density in the nineteenth century, or even fifty years ago, can provide the basis upon which we construct density today?

        An antiquated model of density. We remained limited to unrealistic visions of monocentric density. The outrageous sketch that le corbusier made on his first trip to the united states in 1935 is shocking. His plan to transform manhattan into an enormous radiant city is routinely cited as evidence of his relatively unstable, megalomaniacal ambitions. The problem with manhattan, as he stated it to the new york times “is that its skyscrapers are too small, and there are too many of them.” What his sketch demonstrated was urban construction outgrowing its modest infrastructure of traditional blocks and streets, which he proposed to rip up. Density at the foot of these now enormous buildings would bring economic development to a standstill and bring the city to its knees. A new model of density was required.
