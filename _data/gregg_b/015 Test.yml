        Traditionally, urban development relied heavily on the deployment of typical forms. In american cities, these forms remain recognizable today as street grids hosting a regular arrangement of urban blocks. On these blocks, other typical forms were deployed. Familiar o-shape, u-shape, t-shape and even e-shaped buildings can still to be found today in our older central business districts.
        
        We no longer build traditional urban grids, nor do we deploy typical forms upon them. For the past fifty years, instead of constructing continuous grids, we have constructed discontinuous, spine-base forms that are synonymous with the suburban cul-de-sac. On these spine forms, we do not build classic urban buildings of years gone byâ€”the letter shaped forms that once accounted for a full range of urban programs. In short, the rich typology of continuous street grids populated by a related series of urban blocks has given way to the more primitive typologies of the discontinuous spine populated either by the office slab or the tract house. In order to meet the demands for a sharp increase in density, we will have to be able to deliver a far more robust set of forms than have been offered in the traditional city, and in the city at large today.
        
        The static spine or grid must give way to a far more diverse set of blocks sizes, and a far more diverse set of block types that are distributed with a higher degree of variation that we have had both in the near and distant future.
