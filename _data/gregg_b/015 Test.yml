        ##Economies of Scale
        
        Carbon 2065 projects an urban environment that depends largely on urban density as the key to the necessary cuts in energy consumption through a combination of mass transit and fewer, larger and more energy efficient buildings. Mass transit densities require a catchment of 60 units per acre or approximately 10 times the present density of the typical American city. While the plan achieves these densities, it also recognizes that it is not feasible or desirable to pile up dense new construction in the manner of Manhattan or Hong Kong. The project instead looks to synthesize new models of urban density that are systematically balanced against generous amounts open space.
