        Open forms centered on the major spine (existing Gregg Street) create a dense urban street which supports offices and retail. These new programs extend the preserved fabric of the holdout. Residential is limited to the secondary streets of the new neighborhood spine. 
        
        Spanning 4 city blocks, the largest buildings are up to two tenths of a mile in length. Such economies of scale will not be reached until the later phases of the plan, so these super-blocks are most prevalent in Gregg North and East, the last neighborhoods to be established. However, a few construction lots in Gregg South were left fallow in early years, hosting plantations until populations and economics could support this largest scale of construction.
