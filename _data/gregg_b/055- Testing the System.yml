        In the four neighborhoods of the Gregg district, we have sought to test the limits of the Search Space. Each neighborhood is built from different selection criteria: block sizes, type and shape. 
        
        Spanning 4 city blocks, the largest buildings are up to two tenths of a mile in length. Such economies of scale will not be reached until the later phases of the plan, so these super-blocks are most prevalent in Gregg North and East, the last neighborhoods to be established. However, a few construction lots in Gregg South were left fallow in early years, hosting plantations until populations and economics could support this largest scale of construction. 
        
        ## The four test cases show the diversity of forms the search space enables, from detached self-contained estates to dense, integrated urban spines.
