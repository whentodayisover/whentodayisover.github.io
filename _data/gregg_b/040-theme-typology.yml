        Fixed and variable typology. The need for a new type of density requires more than just the addition of more open space, it requires an entirely new series of protocols. These protocols were largely a matter of typical forms and their routine deployment. In considering the protocols of carbon 2065, an attempt was made to address typical forms that routinely control urban construction. Office towers, single family houses, and urban spines are familiar typical forms in the contemporary city. These typical forms have been greatly reduced in relative to those of the past. While typological forms have defined cities throughout urban history, it is not possible to simply revert to those forms that history provides us. Generated by societies with much different social, ecological, economic, and cultural circumstances, new forms and sets of forms must be produced.  

        The extraordinary demands placed upon urban construction by climate change require a far more robust set of formal choices than those in use by contemporary urban construction. 

        Most sets are formed at the expense of the individual parts. Depending on the strength of the overall order, the integrity of any given part can be lost in or absorbed by the whole. If the identity of the part is limited to its function within the whole, it is “reducible” to the whole. The integrity of the individual part is one of the core leitmotivs of modernism. If the whole collapses—as it has so often in the modern experience—the part endures.
