        Fixed and variable typology. The need for a new type of density requires more than just the addition of more open space, it requires an entirely new series of protocols. These protocols were largely a matter of typical forms and their routine deployment. In considering the protocols of carbon 2065, an attempt was made to address typical forms that routinely control urban construction. Office towers, single family houses, and urban spines are familiar typical forms in the contemporary city. These typical forms have been greatly reduced in relative to those of the past. While typological forms have defined cities throughout urban history, it is not possible to simply revert to those forms that history provides us. Generated by societies with much different social, ecological, economic, and cultural circumstances, new forms and sets of forms must be produced.  

        The extraordinary demands placed upon urban construction by climate change require a far more robust set of formal choices than those in use by contemporary urban construction. 

        Most sets are formed at the expense of the individual parts. Depending on the strength of the overall order, the integrity of any given part can be lost in or absorbed by the whole. If the identity of the part is limited to its function within the whole, it is “reducible” to the whole. The integrity of the individual part is one of the core leitmotivs of modernism. If the whole collapses—as it has so often in the modern experience—the part endures.

        Gifu kitagata housing, sejima and associates, gifu, japan, 1994-2004. This project is part of a large scale public housing reconstruction project of 430 residential units managed by the gifu prefecture. This table constitutes a search space which was generated by a simple translation (vertical) and replication (horizontal) algorithm. It contains within it the set of 20 unit configurations (dark grey) selected for the gifu complex. 

        The table produce sectional types in four quadrants. Variants were produced by reducing the unit of aggregation, not to the unit, but to the room in the unit that was subsequently built up into more complex configurations. “Given that this building is made up of rental apartments, it could be assumed that various types of families would live in those units. In other words, we imagined that forms of cohabitation would not be restricted to the existing standard family, but that different types of groupings of people should be considered. As a result, we regarded the individual room as the planning unit, rather than regarding the residential unit as one element.” 

        As far as we know, such a table was not used in the design process and used here as a strictly analytical tool.
