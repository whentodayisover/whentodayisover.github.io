        Traditionally, urban development relied heavily on the deployment of typical forms. In american cities, these forms remain recognizable today as street grids hosting a regular arrangement of urban blocks. On these blocks, other typical forms were deployed. Familiar o-shape, u-shape, t-shape and even e-shaped buildings can still to be found today in our older central business districts.

        We no longer build traditional urban grids, nor do we deploy typical forms upon them. For the past fifty years, instead of constructing continuous grids, we have constructed discontinuous, spine-base forms that are synonymous with the suburban cul-de-sac. On these spine forms, we do not build classic urban buildings of years gone byâ€”the letter shaped forms that once accounted for a full range of urban programs. In short, the rich typology of continuous street grids populated by a related series of urban blocks has given way to the more primitive typologies of the discontinuous spine populated either by the office slab or the tract house. In order to meet the demands for a sharp increase in density, we will have to be able to deliver a far more robust set of forms than have been offered in the traditional city, and in the city at large today.

        The static spine or grid must give way to a far more diverse set of blocks sizes, and a far more diverse set of block types that are distributed with a higher degree of variation that we have had both in the near and distant future.

          <h3> Tower</h3>
          In order to reach the high densities necessary to reduce per capita energy consumption, the tower is the predominant form in Carbon 2065. While towers can stack many housing units together, alone they risk isolation and detachment from a public ground plane. To learn from past models of density following the Radiant City model, Pruitt Igoe for example, the tower today must be deployed in concert with other horizontal and linear forms that keep it rooted in the ground as it reaches for the sky.

          <h3> Slab</h3>
          As the classic middle-ground element, the slab mediates between the verticality of the tower and the horizontality of the shed and ground plane. In isolation, slabs can become problematic urban walls, but in series with higher and lower buildings, they are an important addition that can help establish direction and hierarchies of place. Like a Gursky photograph, their linear forms can  become a structuring background for Urban life. By both framing the spaces around them, and visually retreating to the horizon, Slabs have the unique capacity  to organize  a neighborhood without becoming the dominant visual element.

          <h3> Shed</h3>
          Low, open, and flexible, the shed is the principle public interface of both Carbon 2065 and inadvertantly Houston today. Linked with the street, it offers opportunities for ground level retail, grocery stores, and civic spaces. On their own, sheds cannot reach densities that support walkable neighborhoods or energy reduction, but in combination with Towers and Slabs, they take the role of a public podium, capable of aggregating everything from parking garages  to  child care centers.
