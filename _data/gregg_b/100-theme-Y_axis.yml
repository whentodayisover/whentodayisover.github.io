        The Y axis of the search space addresses the building types that are employed throughout the plan.  As opposed to a static typology of houses, slabs, sheds and towers, the search space produces a dynamic set of variations of these base elements integrating them into second and third order forms called combines and compounds. As opposed to a single solution to any given building  problem. The search space delivers a series of potential variations calibrated against the parameters of size and distribution found in the other two axes.

          <h6>Elements occupy the top three planes of the search space. Because they contain just one base form, elements typically host a single use. Being incomplete, they can only be deployed as  aggregate elements incapable of standing alone.</h6>

          Elements occupy the top three planes of the search space. Because they contain just one base form, elements typically host a single use. Being incomplete, they can only be deployed as aggregate elements incapable of standing alone. Habussimo condam obultore mera rebus; nonsupio, converi onsimul issimil virtiorum anum consus

        #### The Slab
        
        The slab is the classic middle ground element of the plan. Primarily containing residential spaces, the slab mediates between the tower and the ground plane of sheds and tree plantations.  Smaller building lots are concentrated in gregg south. Here, economies of scale and large block sizes have not yet reached their peak in the first neighborhood to be constructed.

        #### The Shed
        
        Because of its predominant orientation to the ground plane, the shed is the principal public element of carbon 2065. In large and superblocks, the shed takes on the role of a podium. Smaller building lots are concentrated in gregg south. Here, economies of scale and large block sizes have not yet reached their peak in the first neighborhood to be constructed. A second cluster of smaller blocks in exists in the northern arm, where the existing infrastructure splits larger blocks in two.

        #### The Tower
        
        Because of the high densities involved in reducing per capita energy consumption, the tower is the predominant form in carbon 2065. Smaller building lots are concentrated in gregg south. Here, economies of scale and large block sizes have not yet reached their peak in the first neighborhood to be constructed. A second cluster of smaller blocks in exists in the northern arm, where the existing infrastructure splits larger blocks in two.
