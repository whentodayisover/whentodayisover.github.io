          A range of block sizes are built into the y axis of the search space. The sizes are based on the 300’ square dimension of the fifth ward city block. They range from 300’ x 300’ traditional block size to the 300’ x 1500’ superblock size capable of accommodating large building projects and of achieving significant economies of scale. Past a length of 1500’ the blocks transition into bands of cultivation.
