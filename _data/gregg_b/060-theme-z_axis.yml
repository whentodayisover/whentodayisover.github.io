        The z axis of the search space addresses the building types that are employed throughout the plan.  As opposed to a static typology of houses, slabs, sheds and towers, the search space produces a dynamic set of variations of these base elements integrating them into second and third order forms called combines and compounds. As opposed to a single solution to any given building  problem. The search space delivers a series of potential variations calibrated against the parameters of size and distribution found in the other two axes.

          <h4><br/>Elements</h4>

          <h6>Elements occupy the top three planes of the search space. Because they contain just one base form, elements typically host a single use. Being incomplete, they can only be deployed as  aggregate elements incapable of standing alone.</h6>

          <h4><br/>Combine</h4>

          <h6>TCombines Occupy The Middle Three Planes Of The Search Space. Because They Combine Two Base Forms, Combines Are Capable Of Hosting Multiple Variations Of A Single Use. Being More Complete In And Of Themselves, They Are Aggregate Elements Capable Of Standing Alone.</h6>

          <h4><br/>Compound</h4>

          <h6>Combines occupy the middle three planes of the search space. Because they combine two base types, combines are capable of hosting multiple variations of a single use. Being more complete in and of themselves, they are aggregate elements capable of standing alone. Compounds are defined by the combination of three base forms.</h6>
