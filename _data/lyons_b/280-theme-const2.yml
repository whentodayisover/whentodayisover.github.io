        Bands next to spines, the district infrastructure, would be constructed after enough carbon credits are generated through the plantation. Those specific blocks would first be broken into construction sites. Taking advantage of wood products and carbon credits from the plantation, new wood construction will be zero carbon emission and eco-friendly.
