        Plantation grows on blocks outside of holdout. It expands in phases from block to block under a larger ward banding expansion strategy. Blocks with row houses would be prepared first for plantation. Then seedlings are planted, transforming underdeveloped areas into green spaces, which generate carbon credits, remove air pollutants, and produce wood production.
