        # Hardwood

        Softwood and hardwood are terms that refer to the water conducting cells in a living tree from which timber comes, and not to the hardness or softness of the wood itself. When all oak species are combined, this genus accounts for 15 percent of the trees in the region.  Cedar elm is another common species found in Houston, it accounts for 7 percent of all trees in Houston. Eucalyptus is a foreign species, but it grows fast and is efficient in carbon sequestration.

          The wood was hewn from green logs, by axe and wedge, to produce radial planks, similar to quarter-sawn timber. Wide, quarter-sawn boards of oak have been prized since the Middle Ages for

          Oak wood has a great strength and hardness, and is very resistant to insect and fungal attack because of its high tannin content. Oak planking was common on high status Viking

        # Softwood

        Loblolly Pine accounts for 18.7 percent of all trees in Houston, which makes it one of the most primary tree species. Ponderosa ia another pine that is also efficient in terms of carbon sequestration, it shows to be also effective during 60 to 70 years. However, for the shorter periods of time Loblolly Pine tree which is one of the most popular trees in Houston area could be used in effective way of storing Carbon.

        #### Carbon Sequestration

        According to the Houston Regional Forest Report, trees in Houston’s regional forest store 39.2 million tons of carbon, valued at $721 million. Of this amount, 15 percent is stored by one species alone—loblolly pine.

        # Grasses

        Bamboo is a tribe of flowering perennial evergreen plants in the grass family Poaceae, subfamily Bambusoideae, tribe Bambuseae. Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family. Bamboo has a higher compressive strength than wood, brick or concrete and a tensile strength that rivals steel. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

        #### Degraded Lands

        Bamboos tolerance to grow on degraded lands means that bamboo can be used for afforestation/re-forestation measures on lands which would be unsuitable for most trees. In this way, competition between climate change mitigation measures and food production
