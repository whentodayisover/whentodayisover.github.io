        Longer growth cycles may not capture as much carbon (the right side of the diagram to the left), yet they yield longer lasting wood products: CLT, saw lumber, heavy timber. The “half life” of such products can be significantly higher than that of papers and faster growing woods, meaning the carbon absorption is more stable. Until carbon credit trading is a possiblity, long cycles also represent a greater value when sold, potentially financing further redevelopment. Larger, older trees also provide more shade and pleasing environments, the long growth storage focused plantations cluster around new construction. Planted in a wider triangular pattern, individual trees have more access to sunlight and less competition for nutirients, helping to yield higher quality woods.
