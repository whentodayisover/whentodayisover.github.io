        Roughly half the weight of every tree is carbon removed from the environment and temporarily tethered in timber. This transience comes from the eventuality that the tree will one day surrender its cache of carbon to decomposition or fire, yet a way to postpone this cycle is to store carbon in longer lasting wood products. Forestry that is thought of as a carbon farm rather than a nature preserve implies both new methods for management and new potentials for forest sites. Embedding managed forests with future construction in the 5th ward ties carbon production and storage together. Maintenance of both forest and building is critical to ultimate success, not just for carbon, but as a redevelopment proposal. Lapses in building maintenance that have led to the perceived failure of many low income housing projects of the past half century are preempted by the newfound value of the building as storage.
