        Carbon 2065 not only reduces energy consumption it pulls carbon out of the atmosphere and stores it. In this regard, it attempts to integrate urban development into the “carbon cycle.” It will achieve this by harnessing photosynthesis and its by-product, wood. The plan exploits the open space that accompanies urban density as an opportunity for large-scale tree plantations capable of pulling carbon directly out of the atmosphere. Through various species planted and harvested over varying time periods, Carbon 2065 becomes a biotic, carbon remediation facility (a tree farm) that is also a habitable urban environment.
