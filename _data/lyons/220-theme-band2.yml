        Typical band is an effort to integrate plantation, forest and redevelopment into a whole. It is an effort to go against the mono culture plantation brings about by mixing species and types. It brings biodiversity and urban forest, fulfilling biological and environmental concerns. It also turns carbon sequestration, wood production, wood construction and urban forest into a friendly and sustainable cycle, within which all the segregated sections are supporting each other.
